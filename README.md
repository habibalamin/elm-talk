# elm-talk

Please don't judge this codebase or the commits in this repository too harshly; it's an incomplete Elm app to give talks, particularly written to give a talk on Elm at work, and a lot of it was done with little bits of time I had here and there. This is merely a demo, and was not meant for production use.
